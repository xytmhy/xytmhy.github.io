## Welcome to Haoyu Ma's Personal Page

News: Since 2020, I became a Computer Vision Engineer at Apple R&D, Shanghai. 

(Our teams have several positions open on Cameras/Hardware/ISP **in Shanghai**; if insterested, please reach me by haoyu_ma@apple.com.)

I received both my Master's & Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University. 
I also used to be the research intern for Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).

My research interests are in computer vision/image processing and deep learning.
